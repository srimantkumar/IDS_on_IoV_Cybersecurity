# IDS_on_IoV_Cybersecurity
To detect IDS on Iov


## The steps to execute the python notebook and data import process is explained below. ##

1. In the .zip file we have attached the dataset in .csv format and our python notebook in .ipynb format.
2. Unzip the file. After that upload the dataset into Kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/) or Google Colab(https://colab.research.google.com/).
3. Then import the given python notebook into the respective environment.
4. Make sure the file path name is correct. This issue can rise, reason being while importing the dataset we may give different path names from user to user. So, make sure the file name is correct. Then you are good to go.
5. In Kaggle for example if you click on dataset will show the relative path just copy and paste in the line where we are getting data into the dataframe in line no 5 in method read_csv('').
6. Then simply run each cell in the notebook. That's it . You will see our project into action.
7. Once you run the notebook you will see the result the cell.
